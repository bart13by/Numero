* [FIXED]
error after inputing 4 rows -- feels like it must be mixup between rows/cols?
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')
    at redraw (numero.js:80:25)
    at HTMLButtonElement.handleEnter (numero.js:109:2)
redraw @ numero.js:80
handleEnter @ numero.js:109

* [FIXED]
If solution is 9876, input 9999 will show three yellows and one green
* [FIXED]
Key input was blocked after fourth digit on a guess

====================
Improvements
* Add a "restart" button

* PWA
